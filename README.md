## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This [original project](https://github.com/rocketseat-education/nlw-03-omnistack) was created by [RocketSeat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) during the [NLW #03](https://nextlevelweek.com/), an online event from 11 to 18 October 2020.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the application.

```
Node.js
Yarn
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

After cloning the repository, enter the [web](https://github.com/viniciusbe/happy/tree/master/web) directory and install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```
Do the same to [mobile](https://github.com/viniciusbe/happy/tree/master/mobile) and [backend](https://github.com/viniciusbe/happy/tree/master/backend) directories.

Then, in the backend directory, run:

```
npm run dev
```

It should open 2 pages on your browser, one for the mobile application and another with the web application. With your mobile devide, scan the QR code showed in the expo's web page.
